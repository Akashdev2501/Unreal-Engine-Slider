# Unreal-Engine-Slider

Create a slider widget using Unreal Engine 5 that performs the following functions-

1. Upon moving the slider, the value from 0-100 has to reflect in the text box and vice-versa.
2. Encorporate a undo and redo button.
3. The redo button should only be active once the undo button has been clicked.
